Tabs divide content into separate views which users navigate between.

## Design Guidelines

#### Usage
Use tabs for alternate views within the sidenav or main content area.

Don’t use tabs to break user interactions into a series of steps. Serial workflows are best presented in a wizard.

Avoid using tabs in cards and modals.

#### Presentation

Tabs appear in a single, non-scrollable row, above their content. The width of each tab is dependent on its label.

To ensure that all tabs appear in the container, avoid using more than seven tabs and limit labels to one or two words.

#### Content

- While the content within tabs is flexible, follow these guidelines for organization and presentation:
- Ensure that the content in each view is independent of the content in other views.
Don’t force users to navigate back and forth to compare data–keep such content in the same view.
- Avoid cross-linking between tabs.
- If the content within a view is broad, divide it into subsections.

#### Labels

- Ensure that the labels show a clear relationship between views.
- Favor nouns over verbs, for example, Settings, Permissions, and Performance.
- Avoid generic labels such as General or Advanced.
- Use title-style caps.
- Avoid using icons in labels.
